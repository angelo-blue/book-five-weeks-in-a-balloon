 <h4>
 PUBLISHERS’ NOTE.
 </h4>
 <p>
 “Five Weeks in a Balloon” is, in a measure, a satire on modern books of
 African travel. So far as the geography, the inhabitants, the animals, and
 the features of the countries the travellers pass over are described, it
 is entirely accurate. It gives, in some particulars, a survey of nearly
 the whole field of African discovery, and in this way will often serve to
 refresh the memory of the reader. The mode of locomotion is, of course,
 purely imaginary, and the incidents and adventures fictitious. The latter
 are abundantly amusing, and, in view of the wonderful “travellers’ tales”
 with which we have been entertained by African explorers, they can
 scarcely be considered extravagant; while the ingenuity and invention of
 the author will be sure to excite the surprise and the admiration of the
 reader, who will find M. VERNE as much at home in voyaging through the air
 as in journeying “Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Seas.”
